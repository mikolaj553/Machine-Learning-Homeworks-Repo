        "The scikit-learn decision tree with max_depth=2 chose a root threshold at 1.5, producing a final RSS of 79.17, which is consistent with the findings from the counterexample. However, manual testing of each possible first split shows that starting at 2.5 or 4.5 yields a much lower final RSS of 12.50. This gap indicates that scikit-learn's DecisionTreeRegressor relies on a local splitting approach rather than total RSS minimization. If the algorithm used a global search, it would have selected a first split that gave the lowest overall RSS (such as 2.5 or 4.5), but it did not. As a result, we conclude that scikit-learn implements local RSS minimization or RSS gain maximization at each node, rather than total RSS minimization."
